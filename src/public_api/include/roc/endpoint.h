/** Network endpoint.
 *
 * Endpoint is a network entry point of a node. The definition includes the
 * protocol being used, network host and port, and, for some protocols, a
 * resource. All these parts together are unambiguously represented
 * by a URI. The user may set or get the entire URI or its individual parts.
 *
 * **Endpoint URI**
 *
 * Endpoint URI syntax is a subset of the syntax defined in RFC 3986:
 *
 *     protocol://host[:port][/path][?query]
 *
 * Examples:
 *  - `rtsp://localhost:123/path?query`
 *  - `rtp+rs8m://localhost:123`
 *  - `rtp://127.0.0.1:123`
 *  - `rtp://[::1]:123`
 *
 * The following protocols (schemes) are supported:
 *  - `rtp://`       (\ref ROC_PROTO_RTP)
 *  - `rtp+rs8m://`  (\ref ROC_PROTO_RTP_RS8M_SOURCE)
 *  - `rs8m://`      (\ref ROC_PROTO_RS8M_REPAIR)
 *  - `rtp+ldpc://`  (\ref ROC_PROTO_RTP_LDPC_SOURCE)
 *  - `ldpc://`      (\ref ROC_PROTO_LDPC_REPAIR)
 *
 * The host field should be either FQDN (domain name), or IPv4 address, or
 * IPv6 address in square brackets.
 *
 * The port field can be omitted if the protocol defines standard port. Otherwise,
 * the port can not be omitted. For example, RTSP defines standard port,
 * but RTP doesn't.
 *
 * The path and query fields are allowed only for protocols that support them.
 * For example, they're supported by RTSP, but not by RTP.
 *
 * **Field invalidation**
 *
 * If some field is attempted to be set to an invalid value (for example, an invalid
 * port number), this specific field is marked as invalid until it is successfully set
 * to some valid value.
 *
 * Sender and receiver refuse to bind or connect an endpoint which has invalid fields
 * or doesn't have some mandatory fields. Hence, it is safe to ignore errors returned by
 * endpoint setters and check only for errors returned by bind and connect operations.
 *
 * **Thread safety**
 *
 * Should not be used concurrently.
