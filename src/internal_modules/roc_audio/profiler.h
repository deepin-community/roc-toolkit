//! Profiler
//! The role of the profiler is to report the average processing speed (# of samples
//! processed per time unit) during the last N seconds. We want to calculate the average
//! processing speed efficiently (with O(1) complexity, without allocations, and as
//! lightweight as possible). The problems with this are that we have variable-sized
//! frames and SMA requires fixed-size chunks. To efficiently perform this calculation a
//! ring buffer is employed. The idea behind the ring buffer is that each chunk of the
//! buffer is the average speed of 10ms worth of samples. The ring buffer is initialized
//! with fixed size (N * 1000)ms / (10ms) chunks. Within each chunk a weighted mean is
//! used to calculate the average speed during those 10ms. Each frame will contribute a
//! different number of samples to each chunk, the chunk speed is then weighted based on
//! how many samples are contributed at what frame speed. As the chunks get populated the
//! moving average is calculated. When the buffer is not entirely full the cumulative
//! moving average algorithm is used and once the buffer is full the simple moving average
//! algorithm is used.
