Description: real-time audio streaming over the network (shared library)
 Roc is a network transport, highly specialized for the real-time streaming use
 case. The user writes the stream to the one end and reads it from another end,
 and Roc deals with all the complexity of the task of delivering data in time
 and with no loss. Encoding, decoding, adjusting rates, restoring losses - all
 these are performed transparently under the hood.
 .
 This package provides the shared library.
